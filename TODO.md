# To Do

1. Update `players`:
  - `players` will become an `obuf_t`
  - `playeringame` becomes `dboolean playeringame(unsigned short playernum)`
  - `MAXPLAYERS` becomes `VANILLA_MAXPLAYERS` for compat
  - Anything defined using `MAXPLAYERS` will be refactored
  - Servers aren't players
    - Use a camera in non-headless mode
    - All playernums should be unsigned shorts
    - Sending a message to the server can use a bool `to_server` instead of the
      `-1` recipient (which is a hack)

1. Get rid of spurious NetUpdate calls everywhere; they don't help anymore, but
   they do waste bandwidth

1. Fix choppiness between frames; rendering is probably only done at 35Hz if
   interpolation is disabled, which won't work for OpenGL.

1. Have server actually send out updates

1. Compile & Test prototype

1. Add unlagged
  - Save attacking player position
  - Save current game state
  - Restore game state that player was viewing during the attack
    - This is contained in the command
  - Set attacking player position (if possible)
  - Run hit detection & damage calculation
    - For every impacted actor:
      - Save momx/momy/momz values
  - Restore saved state
  - For every impacted actor:
    - Add new momx/momy/momz values to the current momx/momy/momz

1. Add HTTP & JSON
  - Have client download missing WADs
    - the client should do this between frames in case it needs to download a
      huge file (or a file from a slow server); libcurl ought to make this
      pretty easy

1. Make tics unsigned (there's no reason for a tic value to ever be negative)
